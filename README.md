# Copper Tools
Simple Minecraft 1.18.2 Datapack + Textures to add Copper Tools

## Info:
All copper tools are effectively stone tools with haste applied on the user while held. Feel free to use this as a base for creating more elaborate custom datapacks.
There is some redundant code in here but future updates will clean up the code and potentially add further custom items to the datapack.
